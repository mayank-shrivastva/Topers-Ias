                        <h2><u><center> About Civil Services</u></center></h2>
						<ul style="list-style-type: square" >
                        <li>Various Civil Servants of the Government of India, including the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), Indian Foreign Service (IFS), Indian Police Service (IPS) among others are recruited through the Civil Services Examination(CSE), which is a nationwide competitive examination in India conducted by the Union Public Service Commission. Civil Services constitute all non-military departments of the government machinery, which run Government Administration. The Central and the State Civil Servants ensure that the constitutional guarantees and entitlements are brought within the reach of every citizen. The creation of such services provides safeguards for national unity and ensures uniformity of the administrative system throughout the country to maintain common administrative standards. Candidates selected for these services are appointed to different state cadres and as and when required they also move to Central Government jobs on deputation.</li>
						
                         <li>Civil Services in India rank very high as a career option among young students. The power and social status along with job security that a civil servant enjoys is unimaginable in any other profession. The Civil Services also provide great scope for a person with zeal and desire to bring qualitative changes in the functioning of the Government and even opportunities which could improve the lives of millions of Indians.</li>
                          <li>The services encompass all one can aspire for: prestige, job security, salary package, opportunity of foreign tour, job satisfaction, etc. There is diversity of work too – a wide variety of work is associated with civil services, like maintenance of law and order, developmental work, disaster management, representing India on international forum, administration, upliftment and empowerment of marginalised sections of society etc.</li>
                          <li>Civil servants in one way decide the fate of the nation as the implementation of all developmental and other government policy rest with them. If we talk of prestige and respect this is the most prestigious and respectful job of India as it is a job which provides an opportunity to satisfy personal ambition as well as contribute in social welfare. The selection as civil servant is, however, rigorous and only about one thousand candidates are selected out of 9 -10 lakh aspirants every year.</li>
 
 
                          </li><br>
						  
						  <h5> <u>Process of Examination</u></h5>
						  <li>The Civil Services Examination is based on the British Raj – era Imperial Civil Service tests. The Civil Services Examination is considered to be one of the most difficult and competitive examinations in India. On average, 900,000 to 1,000,000 candidates apply every year and the number of candidates appearing to sit the preliminary examination is approximately 450,000. The Civil Services examination consists of the following three stages:</li>
                </ul>
				<ul style="list-style-type: number" >
				<li>Stage I: Preliminary examination – A qualifying test advertised in Feb-March and held in June-July each year. Results are published in mid-August.</li>
<li>Stage II: Main examination – Held in October every year. Results are usually published in the second week of March.</li>

<h6><u>Preliminary Test Stage</u></h6><br>

<li>The pattern of the Preliminary examination up to 2010 was based on the recommendations of the Kothari Commission (1979). It included two examinations, one on general studies worth 150 marks, and the second on one of 23 optional subjects worth 300 marks. Until 2011, when it was revamped, the preliminary pattern was sustained with only minor changes once every ten to fifteen years.</li>
<li>From 2011 onwards, the preliminary examination, now popularly known as the Civil Services Aptitude Test (CSAT)(officially it is still called General Studies Paper-1 and Paper-2), intends to focus on analytical abilities and understanding rather than the ability to memorize. The new pattern includes two papers of two hours duration and 200 marks each. Both papers have multiple choice objective type questions only.They are as under:</li>
<li>Paper I tests the candidate’s knowledge on current events, history of India and Indian national movement, Indian and world geography, Indian polity Panchayti Raj system and governance, economic and social development, environmental ecology, biodiversity, climate change and general science ,Art and culture.</li>
<li>Paper II tests the candidates’ skills in comprehension, interpersonal skills, communication, logical reasoning, analytical ability, decision making, problem solving, basic numeracy, data interpretation, English language comprehension skills and mental ability.</li>
<li>In May 2015, the Government of India announced that Paper II of the preliminary examination will be qualifying in nature i.e. it wouldn’t be graded for eligibility in Mains Examination & a candidate needs to secure at least 33% marks in order to be eligible for graded on basis of Marks of Paper I of Preliminary Examination.</li>

<br>
<h6><u>Mains Stage</u></h6><br>

<li>The Civil Services Mains Examination consists of a written examination and an interview.</li>
<li>The written examination consists of nine papers, two qualifying and seven ranking in nature. The range of questions may vary. Candidates who pass qualifying papers are ranked according to marks and a selected number of candidates are called for interview or a personality test at the Commission’s discretion</li>
<li>According to the new marks allocations in Civil Service Examination 2013 there are some changes made in the examination according to the suggestion of the Prof. S. Nigavekar Committee. However, after some controversy, the qualifying papers for Indian languages and English were restored to the examination.</li>

<h6>Note: Sociology is one of the most sought after optional subjects in Mains examination as it has overlapping content with other subjects like Current Affairs, History, Polity. The standards of Optional papers is of Graduate level. Paper I is theoretical but Paper II is often dominated by Current Affairs and Application based questions.</h6>

<h6><u>Interview</u></h6><br>

<li>Officially called the “Personality Test”, the objective of the interview is to assess the personal suitability of the candidate for a career in public service by a board of competent and unbiased observers. The test is intended to evaluate the mental calibre of a candidate. In broad terms, this is really an assessment of not only a candidate’s intellectual qualities, but also social traits and interest in current affairs. Some of the qualities to be judged are mental alertness, critical powers of assimilation, clear and logical exposition, balance of judgement, variety and depth of interest, ability for social cohesion and leadership, and intellectual and moral integrity.</li>
<li>The technique of the interview is not that of a strict cross-examination, but of a natural, though directed and purposive conversation that is intended to reveal the mental qualities of the candidate.</li>
<li>The interview is not intended to be a test either of the specialised or general knowledge of the candidate, which has been already tested through written papers. Candidates are expected to have taken an intelligent interest not only in their special subjects of academic study, but also in the events which are happening around them both within and outside their own state or country as well as in modern currents of thought and in new discoveries which should rouse the curiosity of all well-educated youth.</li>
